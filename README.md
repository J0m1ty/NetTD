# .NetTD
NetTD is a Unity multiplayer tower defence game, made with hexagons in mind. This is a research and development project for my CSC 246 class.

This is the client code, the Node.js server is over at [NetTDServer](https://github.com/J0m1ty/NetTDServer). This project is also on [itch.io](https://jomity.itch.io/nettd).

# Instructions
F11 to toggle fullscreen. Create an account and find someone to play with (either irl or through the global chat). Start the game and use mouse/WSAD to move, and T/G to place down towers. Press ESC to leave the game.

# Builds
A windows build is avaiable under releases. WebGL is not available unfortunately.
