# .NetTD
NetTD is a Unity multiplayer tower defence game, made with hexagons in mind. This is a research and development project for my CSC 246 class.

This is the client code, the Node.js server is over at my repo [UnityServer](https://github.com/J0m1ty/UnityServer).

# Instructions
Windows builds will be available when the game is more finished. WebGL soon after that, hopefully.
